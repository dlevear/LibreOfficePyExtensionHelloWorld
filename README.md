This is intended to be an extension template for LibreOffice Calc using Python.

A lot of this was adapted from an example called TuesdayPrinter that I found [here](https://git.libreoffice.org/sdk-examples/), which is licensed under MPL. For this reason, this repo is also licensed under MPL.

For more licensing information, see `description/license.txt`.
