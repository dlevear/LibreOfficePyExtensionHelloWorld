This is a LibreOffice Calc extension written in Python.

It's intended to be a kind of template for me (maybe others). It just creates a Hello World dialog box and sets the contents of cell A1 when you click a button.

A lot of this was adapted from an example extension called TuesdayPrinter that I found [here](https://git.libreoffice.org/sdk-examples/), which is licensed under MPL. For this reason, this repo is also licensed under MPL.

# Possible improvements
- [ ] I wonder if there's a way to make the toolbar icon and menu only show up if you're in LibreOffice Calc. Since this extension fails in any other LibreOffice document, it seems wrong to have the button appear in those modes.
